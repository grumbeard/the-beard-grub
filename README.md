# The Odin Project
# Project #7: Restaurant Homepage

**Goal**: Create a restaurant homepage that deploys Webpack and NPM as part of The Odin Project [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/restaurant-page).

**Live Link**: ðŸ‘‰ https://grumbeard.github.io/the-beard-grub/

## About
This assignment comes right after a few tutorials on the history of Modern JavaScript where developers found ways to better manage the use of external libraries and incorporate a build step to output browser-compatible JavaScript.

The Beard Grub ('Beard-Soakingly Good Grub') is a make-belief <s>sanctuary</s> restaurant for bearded patrons itching to eat all the food they usually have to abstain from in public eateries because of their sauce-yness. This is it's homepage.

No external libraries were necessary for the project as the main goal is to practice configuring Webpack on a project from scratch and running builds and other scripts with NPM.

## Technologies
HTML / CSS, JavaScript, NPM, Webpack (incl. CLI, Webpack-Dev-Server)

*HTML Contents fully generated by JavaScript for this project*

## Key Learnings
- Deploying NPM on project
  - Package.json: Configuring scripts for serving page on local server (webpack-dev-server configured as `webpack serve` for Webpack 5)
  - Node_Modules: Initializing .gitignore file for node modules
- Managing source and distribution code separately
  - Linking stylesheet when using webpack
- Deploying subfolder to GitHub (using `subtree`)
- Creating a scrollable sub-section
- Fun fact about CSS grids: min-width defaults to auto (may cause blowouts)
